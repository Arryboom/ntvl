supernode \- ntvl supernode daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B supernode \-l <port> [\-v]
.SH DESCRIPTION
NTVL is a Nat Traversal LAN & peer-to-peer VPN system. Supernode is a node
introduction registry, broadcast conduit and packet relay node for the ntvl
system. On startup supernode begins listening on the specified UDP port for
node registrations, and other packets to route. The supernode can service
any number of communities and routes packets only between members of the same
community. The supernode does not hold the community encryption key and so 
cannot snoop or inject packets into the community.
.PP
Supernode can service a number of ntvl communities concurrently. Traffic does not
cross between communities.
.PP
All logging goes to stdout.

normal traffic flow to resume.
